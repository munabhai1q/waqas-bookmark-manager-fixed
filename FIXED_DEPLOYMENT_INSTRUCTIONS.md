# Corrected Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY to deploy this app properly on Replit:

## Step 1: Run the FIXED deployment script

```bash
node deploy-script/replit-fix.mjs
```

This improved script:
1. Builds the application
2. Creates a special static file server
3. Copies files to the correct locations
4. Temporarily updates package.json for deployment

## Step 2: Click DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY

After running the script, you have 60 SECONDS to click the DEPLOY button in Replit.
The script temporarily modifies package.json and will revert it after 1 minute.

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, your app should show the actual web interface instead of source code.

## Troubleshooting

If you still see source code:
1. Try running the deployment script again and deploying immediately after
2. Clear your browser cache or try in incognito mode
3. Consider adding a custom domain in Replit settings
