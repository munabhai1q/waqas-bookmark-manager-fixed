# Super Simple Vercel Deployment Fix

This is a last-resort fix for Vercel deployment issues. When all other methods fail, try this extremely simplified approach.

## Instructions

1. Run the simplified deployment script:
   ```
   node vercel-fix/simpler-deploy.js
   ```

2. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add simplified Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel by importing your GitHub repository

This approach creates a very basic configuration that focuses exclusively on serving files correctly, without trying to get your backend API running.

## What This Does

- Creates an extremely simple Express server for Vercel
- Sets up a minimal configuration that strictly focuses on file serving
- Avoids deployment complexity by focusing on just getting the frontend visible

## Why This May Work When Others Fail

The simpler approach is more likely to work because:
1. It has fewer moving parts
2. It mirrors Vercel's preferred static deployment pattern
3. It focuses solely on making your content visible (API functionality will need to be restored later)
